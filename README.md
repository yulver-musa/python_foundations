This repository contains a collection of small Python scripts I created while learning and practicing Python fundamentals. Each script is focused on a specific concept and includes comments or explanations to make the learning process easier.

This repo is mainly for:

Practicing Python basics

Serving as a reference for future projects

Sharing code with others who are learning Python

Notes Scripts are written for Python 3.9

Some examples may include extra comments for learning purposes
